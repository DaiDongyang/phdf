Submission

Student authors are invited to submit research papers on original work (including recently published work) describing current research and novel ideas in Multimedia, Web Mining, Networking and Big Data. Papers whose contributions are supported by experimental evaluations are strongly encouraged.
Copyright of the submitted work is held by the author/owner.
Authors should submit a four-page manuscript in double-column IEEE format including authors' names, affiliations, and a short abstract. Only electronic submission written in English will be accepted. Please download the paper format and sample files from the Author's Kit above.
Submissions can be made by sending email enclosed with manuscript to phdforum2018@126.com. The title of submission email is expected to conform with the format of
"[PaperSubmission][FIRST_AUTHOR_NAME_ABBR]-PAPERTITLE"

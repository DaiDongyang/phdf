            <p class="invitf">Deep neural networks (DNNs) are becoming ubiquitous in designing speech processing algorithms. However, the robustness issues that have hindered a wide-spread deployment of speech technologies for decades still have not been fully resolved. In this talk, we first discuss capabilities and limitations of deep learning technologies. Next, we illustrate three knowledge-rich techniques, namely: (1) automatic speech attribute transcription (ASAT) integrating acoustic phonetic knowledge into speech processing and computer assisted pronunciation training (CAPT), (2) Bayesian DNNs leveraging upon speaker information for adaptation and system combination, and (3) DNN-based speech pre-processing, demonstrating better acoustics leads to more accurate speech recognition. Finally, we argue that domain knowledge in speech, language and acoustics is heavily needed beyond current blackbox deep learning in order to formulate sustainable whitebox solutions to further advance speech technologies.

				Bolei Zhou is currently an Assistant Professor at the Information Engineering Department of The Chinese University of Hong Kong.  Professor Zhou’s main areas of research are in computer vision and machine learning, with a particular interest in visual scene understanding and interpretable AI systems.  His representative work includes the large-scale scene benchmarks Places Database and Places-CNN, ADE20K Dataset, as well as neural network interpretation methods Class Activation Mapping (CAM) and Network Dissection. Recently I investigate video scene understanding, with work Temporal Relational Reasoning and Moments in Time.

                <p class="invitf">Internet of Things (IoT) represent a broad class of systems which interact with the physical world by tightly integrating sensing, communication, and compute with physical objects. Many IoT applications are data-intensive and mission-critical in nature, which generate significant amount of data that must be processed within stringent time constraints. It’s estimated that 0.75 GB of data can be produced by an autonomous vehicle each second. The existing Cloud computing paradigm is inadequate for such applications due to significant or unpredictable delay and concerns on data privacy.<br />In this talk, I will present our recent work on Edge AI, which aims to address the challenges of data-intensive IoT by intelligently distributing compute, storage, control and networking along the continuum from Cloud to Things. First, I will present ORBIT, a system for programming Edge systems and partitioning compute tasks among network tiers to minimize the system power consumption while meeting application deadlines. ORBIT has been employed in several systems for seismic sensing, vision-based tracking, and multi-camera 3D reconstruction. Second, I will briefly describe several systems we developed for mobile health, smart cities, volcano and aquatic monitoring, which integrate domain-specific physical models with AI algorithms. We have conducted several large-scale field deployments for these systems, including installing a seismic sensor network at two live volcanoes in Ecuador and Chile.

                  <p class="invitf">Psychological stress and depression are threatening people’s health. It is non-trivial to detect stress or depression timely for proactive care. With the popularity of social media, people are used to sharing their daily activities and interacting with friends on social media platforms, making it feasible to leverage online social media data for stress and depression detection. In this talk, we will systematically introduce our work on stress and depression detection employing large-scale benchmark datasets from real-world social media platforms, including 1)  stress-related and depression-related textual, visual and social attributes from various aspects, 2) novel hybrid models for binary stress detection, stress event and subject detection, and cross-domain depression detection, and finally 3) several intriguing phenomena indicating the special online behaviors of stressed as well as depressed people. We would also like to demonstrate our developed mental health care applications at the end of this talk.

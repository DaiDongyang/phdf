            <p class="invitf">Deep neural networks (DNNs) are becoming ubiquitous in designing speech processing algorithms. However, the robustness issues that have hindered a wide-spread deployment of speech technologies for decades still have not been fully resolved. In this talk, we first discuss capabilities and limitations of deep learning technologies. Next, we illustrate three knowledge-rich techniques, namely: (1) automatic speech attribute transcription (ASAT) integrating acoustic phonetic knowledge into speech processing and computer assisted pronunciation training (CAPT), (2) Bayesian DNNs leveraging upon speaker information for adaptation and system combination, and (3) DNN-based speech pre-processing, demonstrating better acoustics leads to more accurate speech recognition. Finally, we argue that domain knowledge in speech, language and acoustics is heavily needed beyond current blackbox deep learning in order to formulate sustainable whitebox solutions to further advance speech technologies.

                  <p class="invitf">Psychological stress and depression are threatening people’s health. It is non-trivial to detect stress or depression timely for proactive care. With the popularity of social media, people are used to sharing their daily activities and interacting with friends on social media platforms, making it feasible to leverage online social media data for stress and depression detection. In this talk, we will systematically introduce our work on stress and depression detection employing large-scale benchmark datasets from real-world social media platforms, including 1)  stress-related and depression-related textual, visual and social attributes from various aspects, 2) novel hybrid models for binary stress detection, stress event and subject detection, and cross-domain depression detection, and finally 3) several intriguing phenomena indicating the special online behaviors of stressed as well as depressed people. We would also like to demonstrate our developed mental health care applications at the end of this talk.

                      <p class="invitf">Energy consumption represents a significant cost in data center operation. In 2010, data centers world-wide consumed 240 billion kWh electricity (1.3% of the world total), enough to power 5+ Hong Kong or roughly the entire Spain. However, real-world statistics reveals that a large fraction of the energy is used to power idle servers when the workload is low. Dynamic provisioning techniques aim at saving this portion of the energy, by turning off unnecessary servers. In dynamic provisioning, it is a common approach to predict future workload to certain extent and exploit the information to achieve good performance. This naturally leads to the following fundamental questions:<br/>
                        - Can we design solutions that require zero future workload information, called online solutions, yet still achieve close-to-optimal performance?<br/>
                        - Can we characterize the benefit of knowing future workload information in dynamic provisioning?<br/>
                        <p class="invitf">In this work, we seek answers to the above questions. In particular, we develop online dynamic provisioning solutions with and without future workload information available. We first reveal an elegant structure of the off-line dynamic provisioning problem, which allows us to characterize the optimal solution in a “divide-and-conquer” manner. We then exploit this insight to design two online algorithms with competitive ratios 2-α and  e/(e-1+α) , respectively, where 0≤α≤1 is the normalized size of a look-ahead window in which exact workload prediction is available. We prove that these competitive ratios are the best possible for deterministic and randomized algorithms; hence, they characterize the benefit of predicting future workload. A fundamental observation is that future workload information beyond the full-size look-ahead window (corresponding to  α=1) will not improve dynamic provisioning performance. We remark that our results hold as long as the overall energy demands (including mainly server, cooling, and power conditioning) is a convex and increasing function in the total number of active servers. Our algorithms are decentralized and easy to implement. We demonstrate 20-71% of energy saving in a case study using real-world traces.
